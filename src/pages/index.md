      You almost forgot about this app to be open in one of your tabs when you see a notification. That weird guy with a big beard nicknamed xxxILovePizzaxxx just left you a message. Invaded by curiosity you click on it and open the chat panel:

      \- "Yo man what the hell are you doing? You look pretty dumb while staring at your screen!"

    content: You are sure that the man in front of you looks 10 times dumber than
      you ever have. You go to the public chat and share the horrendous message the
      guy sent you. Everybody in the room agrees it's time to ban xxxILovePizzaxxx
      to never see him again.

    content: "Through Deskters you gained a great boost in social confidence. You
      started working out and went in a keto vegan diet. Married a beautiful woman,
      had 3 children and bought a majestic apartment in the city center. You are on
      top of the world. \n\nOne day when walking into a bar you notice a drunk man,
      laying on the ground completely wasted. You could never forget that beard. xxxILovePizzaxxx
      is there, a destiny way too harsh to withstand. \n\nNobody deserves to get that
      low in life and you feel happy that destiny brought you to click that magic
      link on a lucky day of 10 years ago."

  - question: This site is pretty bad. Couldn't you put a little more effort?
    answer: I guess you are right. But when you are busy making an app, debugging,
      managing servers, working 8 hours at your main job, swimming, cooking, spending
      time with your family... I guess you get the point.
  - answer: Yes it is. But I added that big fancy button at the bottom right to allow
      you to report all the bugs I will eventually fix.
    question: The app is buggy
  - question: How do I kick a user from a room
    answer: 'Well... that''s actually on my to-do list. You can of course leave your
      email address (which I''m totally not going to use to spam you) to let you know
      when it will be added. '
  - question: I'd like having this fancy functionality that is totally easy to implement
      in 10 minutes
    answer: Yeah sure... well just leave a message with the update you are dreaming
      of by clicking the bottom right chat button.
