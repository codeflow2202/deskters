Hi, my name is Luca and I try to be web-developer/designer/writer/entrepreneur(hah!) from somewhere in northern Europe.

As you might have heard life here is pretty harsh. I can't even remember the last time I saw the sun up here. Actually I do. It was 23 days ago and it was just for an hour or so. Now I'm lucky if for once I can get to work without being completely wet because of the rain.

As anyone who has at least a bit of will to keep his own mental sanity I'm spending every minute putting as much effort as I can to become rich enough to escape this situation together with my family.

Here is where Deskters comes into play. This site is my last effort to direct my life towards my next goal. Live and work on a beach where it is summer the whole year.

You might think, hey you can't become rich by making a free app! And yes I agree. But I have a plan... a big, big plan.

PS. I don't know and I'm not related to anyone on the picture on this page.
